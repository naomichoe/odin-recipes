    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the rice cakes for about 20 minutes or longer unless you’re using freshly made soft rice cakes.</li>
        <li>Cut the fish cake, cabbage, and scallions into about 2-inch long pieces.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, stir in the sauce ingredients to the anchovy broth (or water). Bring it to a boil before adding the rice cakes.</li>
        <li>Add the rice cakes, and boil until the rice cakes become very soft and the sauce is thickened, about 8 – 10 minutes (can be longer), stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables and fish cakes. Continue to boil, stirring constantly, for an additional 4 – 6 minutes. Depending on rice cakes, you may need more time to reach a desired level of softness. Feel free to add more broth or water as necessary.</li>
